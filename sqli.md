first we tried any value to check for the logic of the webpage to check if filling the password was necessairy
then we tried to type and sql statement inside the username text field and got that the database was based on MariaDB
then proceeded to find that the password field was encypted so we commented it after filling the username with "admin' OR 1=1;#"
